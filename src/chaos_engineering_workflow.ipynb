    "1. **Hypothesis Generation** - Analyze the AWS workload and generate chaos engineering hypotheses\n",
    "2. **Hypothesis Prioritization** - Prioritize hypotheses based on impact and feasibility\n",
    "3. **Experiment Design** - Create AWS FIS experiment templates for prioritized hypotheses\n",
    "4. **FIS Setup** - Set up experiments in AWS FIS with real resources\n",
    "5. **Experiment Execution** - Execute selected experiments and monitor results\n",
    "6. **Results Analysis** - Analyze results and generate insights for system improvements\n",
