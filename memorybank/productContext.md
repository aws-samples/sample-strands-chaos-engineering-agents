# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

The Chaos Engineering Agent project exists to democratize and streamline the practice of chaos engineering for software teams. Chaos engineering is a discipline that helps teams build resilient systems by deliberately injecting failures and observing system behavior. However, implementing chaos engineering effectively requires specialized knowledge and significant effort, which can be barriers to adoption.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Knowledge Gap**: Many teams lack expertise in chaos engineering principles and methodologies.
2. **Resource Constraints**: Teams often don't have dedicated resources to design and execute chaos experiments.
3. **Inconsistent Implementation**: Without structured guidance, chaos engineering efforts can be ad hoc and ineffective.
4. **Analysis Complexity**: Interpreting results from chaos experiments and translating them into actionable improvements can be challenging.
5. **Scaling Challenges**: Manual chaos engineering processes don't scale well across large systems or organizations.

## How It Should Work

The system operates through a set of specialized agents that work together to implement a complete chaos engineering workflow:

1. **Hypothesis Generation Agent**: Analyzes system architecture, documentation, and monitoring data to generate potential failure hypotheses.
2. **Prioritization Agent**: Evaluates and ranks hypotheses based on impact, likelihood, and system criticality.
3. **Experiment Design Agent**: Creates detailed experiment plans for testing specific hypotheses.
4. **Experiment Execution Agent**: Safely runs experiments using AWS FIS and collects result data.
5. **Learning & Iteration Agent**: Updates the hypothesis backlog based on experiment outcomes and system changes.

The workflow is designed to be user-guided but agent-driven, allowing teams to maintain control while benefiting from automation and AI assistance.

## User Experience Goals

1. **Accessible**: Make chaos engineering approachable for teams without specialized expertise.
2. **Guided**: Provide clear explanations and recommendations throughout the process.
3. **Transparent**: Ensure users understand what actions are being taken and why.
4. **Safe**: Implement guardrails to prevent unintended consequences during experiments.
5. **Educational**: Help teams learn chaos engineering principles through interaction with the agents.
6. **Efficient**: Reduce the time and effort required to implement effective chaos engineering.
7. **Integrated**: Work seamlessly with existing AWS infrastructure and monitoring tools.
8. **Actionable**: Deliver clear insights and recommendations that teams can implement.

## Target Users

1. **DevOps Engineers**: Responsible for system reliability and operations.
2. **SRE Teams**: Focused on service reliability and resilience.
3. **Development Teams**: Building and maintaining the software systems.
4. **Platform Engineers**: Managing the infrastructure that supports applications.
5. **Engineering Managers**: Overseeing system quality and reliability initiatives.
